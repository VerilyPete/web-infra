feat: refactor deployment workflow for production/staging environments

- Replace optional custom hostname with required choice between webserver-prod/webserver-staging
- Remove instance discovery logic since target hostname is now known upfront
- Add automatic termination of existing instances before fresh deployment
- Implement dynamic Cloudflare tunnel token selection based on environment:
  * webserver-prod → CLOUDFLARE_PROD_TUNNEL_TOKEN
  * webserver-staging → CLOUDFLARE_STAGING_TUNNEL_TOKEN
- Simplify conditional logic throughout workflow by removing instance search steps
- Update cleanup job to exclude current instance from old instance listing
- Fix SSH heredoc to allow variable expansion for dynamic token injection
- Improve workflow reliability and predictability for multi-environment deployments

This change makes the deployment process more deterministic and suitable
for managing both production and staging environments with clear separation
of concerns and configuration.
